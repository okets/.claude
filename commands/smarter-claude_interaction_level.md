# Set smarter-claude Interaction Level

I'll update your smarter-claude interaction level setting.

Usage: `/smarter-claude_interaction_level <level>`

Valid levels:
- **0** or **silent**: No TTS announcements
- **1** or **quiet**: Sound notifications only  
- **2** or **concise**: Brief planning and completion announcements
- **3** or **verbose**: Detailed workflow narration with context awareness
- **4**: Maximum verbosity (same as verbose currently)

!# Use the settings management system for proper cascading
MANAGE_SETTINGS="$HOME/.claude/hooks/utils/manage_settings.py"

# Get the argument (interaction level)
LEVEL="$1"

if [ -z "$LEVEL" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Please specify an interaction level"
