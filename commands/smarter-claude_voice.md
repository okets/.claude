# Set smarter-claude Voice

I'll update your smarter-claude voice engine setting.

Usage: `/smarter-claude_voice <voice>`

Valid voices:
- **coqui-female**: High-quality female Coqui TTS voice
- **coqui-male**: High-quality male Coqui TTS voice  
- **macos-female**: macOS built-in female voice (Samantha)
- **macos-male**: macOS built-in male voice (Alex)
- **pyttsx3**: Python text-to-speech default voice

!# Use the settings management system for proper cascading
MANAGE_SETTINGS="$HOME/.claude/hooks/utils/manage_settings.py"
VOICE_MANAGER="$HOME/.claude/hooks/utils/manage_voices.py"

# Get the argument (voice)
VOICE="$1"
