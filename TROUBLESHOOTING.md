## ü§ñ The Claude Way

**Just copy and paste these prompts into your Claude Code session:**

üí° **Need manual commands?** Jump to [Manual Troubleshooting](#manual-troubleshooting) at the bottom.

### Installation Issues

#### Installation Script Failed
**Symptom**: The one-line installation script doesn't work

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
The smarter-claude installation script failed. Can you help me troubleshoot what went wrong? Please check if Claude Code is installed, if I have the right permissions, and guide me through a manual installation if needed.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#installation-script-failed-manual)

#### Hook Files Not Found
**Symptom**: Claude Code starts but no database files are created

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
Check if my smarter-claude hooks are properly installed. Look for the hook files in ~/.claude/hooks/ and verify they're executable. If anything is missing or broken, please fix it.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#hook-files-not-found-manual)

#### Python Import Errors
**Symptom**: Error messages about missing modules

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
I'm getting Python import errors with smarter-claude hooks. Can you check the hook file structure and Python paths? Fix any import issues you find.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#python-import-errors-manual)

### TTS Issues

#### Coqui TTS Not Working
**Symptom**: TTS falls back to system voice or no audio

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
My smarter-claude TTS isn't working properly - it's not using the Coqui voice I configured. Can you check if Coqui TTS is installed correctly and test the TTS system? If needed, please install or fix the Coqui TTS setup.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#coqui-tts-not-working-manual)

#### Male Voice Sounds Wrong
**Symptom**: Male voice is too high-pitched or distorted

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
The male TTS voice in smarter-claude sounds wrong - it's too high-pitched or distorted. Can you check if ffmpeg is installed properly and fix the male voice audio processing?
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#male-voice-sounds-wrong-manual)

#### No Audio Output
**Symptom**: No sound from any TTS engine

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
I'm not getting any audio from smarter-claude TTS. Can you check my TTS settings, interaction level, and audio system? Please diagnose why there's no sound and fix it.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#no-audio-output-manual)

### Database Issues

#### Database Not Created
**Symptom**: No `smarter-claude.db` file in project

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
My smarter-claude database isn't being created in this project. Can you check the project detection logic and ensure the database directory is set up correctly? Create the database structure if needed.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#database-not-created-manual)

#### Permission Denied on Database
**Symptom**: SQLite permission errors

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
I'm getting permission errors with the smarter-claude database. Can you check and fix the file permissions for the database and its directory?
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#permission-denied-on-database-manual)

#### Corrupted Database
**Symptom**: SQLite errors when querying

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
My smarter-claude database seems corrupted - I'm getting SQLite errors. Can you check the database integrity and either repair it or recreate it safely? Please backup any existing data first.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#corrupted-database-manual)

### Notification Issues

#### Notifications Not Appearing
**Symptom**: No TTS announcements during Claude Code usage

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
I'm not getting any TTS notifications from smarter-claude during our conversation. Can you check the notification hook system and my interaction level settings? Test and fix the notification system.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#notifications-not-appearing-manual)

#### Wrong Notification Format
**Symptom**: Garbled or incorrect notification messages

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
The smarter-claude notifications sound garbled or have the wrong format. Can you check the notification message formatting and transcript parsing? Fix any issues with how user requests are being extracted and announced.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#wrong-notification-format-manual)

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Hook Execution
**Symptom**: Claude Code feels sluggish

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
Claude Code is running slowly, possibly due to smarter-claude hooks taking too long. Can you check hook execution performance and optimize the settings? Maybe reduce the interaction level if needed.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#slow-hook-execution-manual)

#### Large Database File
**Symptom**: Database grows very large over time

**Ask Claude to fix**:
```
My smarter-claude database file is getting very large. Can you check the database size, vacuum it to reclaim space, and adjust the cleanup settings to prevent it from growing too large?
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#large-database-file-manual)

## Debug Mode

**Ask Claude to enable debug mode**:
```
Can you enable debug mode for smarter-claude so I can troubleshoot an issue? Please turn on detailed logging and show me where to find the debug files.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#debug-mode-manual)

## System Status Check

**Ask Claude to check system status**:
```
Can you check the overall health of my smarter-claude installation? Please verify the settings, database connection, and all components are working properly.
```

üìñ [Manual steps](#system-status-check-manual)

## Nuclear Option: Reset Everything

**Ask Claude to reset the system**:
```
I need to completely reset smarter-claude to a fresh state. Can you backup my current settings, then remove all project data and reset everything to default? I want to start clean.
```

# Manual Troubleshooting

If you prefer command-line troubleshooting or Claude can't help, here are the manual steps:

## Installation Issues

### Installation Script Failed Manual
```bash
# Check if Claude Code is installed
claude --version
# If not found, install from: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

# Check if ~/.claude directory exists
ls -la ~/.claude
# If not found, create it: mkdir -p ~/.claude

# Check internet connection and GitHub access
curl -I https://github.com/okets/smarter-claude
# Should return HTTP 200

# Try manual download
cd ~/.claude
git clone https://github.com/okets/smarter-claude .

# Make hooks executable
chmod +x hooks/*.py

# Test basic functionality
python3 -c "from hooks.utils.contextual_db import ContextualDB; print('Success')"
```

### Hook Files Not Found Manual
```bash
# Verify hooks directory structure
ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/
# Should see: notification.py, post_tool_use.py, pre_tool_use.py, stop.py

# Check hook permissions
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.py
```

### Python Import Errors Manual
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct directory structure
cd ~/.claude
pwd  # Should show /Users/yourusername/.claude
